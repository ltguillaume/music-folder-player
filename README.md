An elegant HTML5 web folder player for parties and/or private music collections, with a playlist system that all players should have had. It does not use a database (so it's alway up-to-date), but can easily handle folders with 25,000 songs or more. It has no dependencies other than PHP and installation costs less than 2 minutes. The design should be fully responsive on CSS3-compatible browsers.
