# Music Folder Player
by ltGuillaume: [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/ltGuillaume) | [GitHub](https://github.com/ltGuillaume) | [Buy me a beer](https://buymeacoff.ee/ltGuillaume) üç∫

An elegant HTML5 web folder player for parties and/or private music collections, with a playlist system that all players should have had. It does not use a database (so it's alway up-to-date), but can easily handle folders with 25,000 songs or more. It has no dependencies other than PHP and installation costs less than 2 minutes. The design should be fully responsive on CSS3-compatible browsers.

## Overview

#### Player
- Click on cover image to zoom (300x300px, again for full size)
- Click on current song or folder name to find it in the library
- Right-click Volume to mute
- Right-click Next to skip current artist

#### Options
- Enqueue: Click on songs in the library to add songs to the end of the playlist, instead of playing them (next). Right-click to suggest a random song to enqueue.
- Random: pick the next song randomly from the upcoming songs (songs added using "Play next" take precedence)
	- Right-click Random to shuffle upcoming songs (songs added using "Play next" will stay in place)
- Crossfade: start playing the next song 10s before ending the current and fade out the current song
- Password lock the playlist and playlist controls (allowing only Enqueue, Play/pause and Share)
	- Tip: use [OpenKiosk](http://openkiosk.mozdevgroup.com) and disable _Set Inactive Terminal_
- Do not add previously played songs to playlist (optional)

#### Playlist

- Click on a song to play directly
- Drag and drop to change the order, drag to bin to remove
- Right-click a song to find it in the library
- Choose how to continue when the playlist is exhausted:
	- Stop playback
	- Repeat the playlist
	- Continue from the last played song's position in the library
	- Randomly select unplayed songs from the (filtered) library
- Playlist and configuration will be saved to the browser's Local Storage if possible
- Load/save online playlists (can be disabled)
- Import/export playlists from/to a local file

#### Library
- Rebuilds the tree of a specified folder, showing only files with supported extensions
- Use arrow keys to traverse the library tree, Enter to play/enqueue, or Shift-Enter to play next/add folder
- Click a song to play (or enqueue when "Enqueue" mode is enabled)
- Clicking on a song will never clear the playlist (looking at you, ol' Winamp)
- Play next: right-click (long-press) a song to play it next ("Play next" songs will play in "FIFO" order)
- Right-click a folder to add all its songs to the playlist
- Prevents adding a song if it's already queued up (unless "Play next" is used)
- Sports a library (instant) filter to quickly find songs
